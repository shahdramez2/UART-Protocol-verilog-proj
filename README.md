# UART-Protocol-verilog-proj
The UART protocol implemented is done using the oversampling concept, where each bit is read at its middle to ensure more stability.
You will find an attached powerpoint document which includes blocks used and their connections along with the FSM used for transmitter and receiver.
Plus you will find the elaborated design obtained from Vivado.
